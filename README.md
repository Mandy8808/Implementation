# Numerical Implementation:
In this repository we present a set of Python modules, Jupyter and Mathematica notebook used to study the stability of scalar-compact objects. The numerical implementations and algorithms correspond to the results reported in the papers:

# [On the linear stability of nonrelativistic selfinteracting boson stars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07998.pdf)

The repository **LS_selfinteraction_BS** consists of two folders:
- **Module**: where appear a module with the used functions.
- **SI_BS**: where appear in the folders: Eingevalues_Eingevectors, Profiles_and_Modes and Plots the jupyter's notebooks used for the background solution, its perturbations, and generate some plots.

Note: We donâ€™t include in this repository all our numerical data profiles for the different modes. However, this could be solicited by email or computed using the present notebooks.

# [Are nonrelativistic ground state ell-boson stars only stable for ell=0 and ell=1?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18405)

The repository **AGS_ell_boson** consists of two folders: 

- **Modules**: where appear the different modules used.
- **ell_boson**: where appear the jupyter's notebooks used for the background solution, its perturbations, and generate some plots.

# [Total light bending in non-asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad0e81)

The repository **TLB_non_asymptoticallyFBHST** comprises two folders: 

- **Mathematica's notebook**: This folder contains Mathematica notebooks presenting the null-geodesic solutions and the triangular configurations studied.
- **Python jupyter's notebooks**: This folder includes Jupyter notebooks utilized for validating the Mathematica results and generating the plots.

# [On the radial linear stability of nonrelativistic \ell-boson stars](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.084001)

The repository **RL_Stability** consists of two folders: 

- **Modules**: where appear the different modules used.
- **ell_boson**: where appear the jupyter's notebooks used to computed the background solutions, its perturbations, and generate some plots.
