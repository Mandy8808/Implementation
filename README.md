# [On the radial linear stability of nonrelativistic $\ell$-boson stars](https:)

The repository consists of two folders: 

- **Modules**: where appear the different modules used.
- **ell_boson**: where appear the jupyter's notebooks used for the background solution, its perturbations, and generate some plots.
